  `The objective of this project is to give you practical guidance on how to improve your digital security, and protect your privacy online.`,
  `
  The checklist is a living document, and will be updated regularly to reflect the latest threats and best practices.
  This is made possible by open sourcing the content, and making it a community maintained resource,
  meaning that anyone can suggest changes, make additions or update the guidance.
  All edits are then reviewed by maintainers before being merged and going live.
